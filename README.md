# Movie-Review-Analysis
This is a ML based movie review sentimental analysis project. Sentimental analysis of movie reviews plays a key role in rating the movies so as to help users in deciding 
whether to go for a particular movie or not. At present Machine Learning models are used to determine two sentiments namely–
positive or negative. This project proposes the use of 3 ML models and tested on Kaggle dataset in predicting 5 sentiments from
movie reviews and hence determining the best of the three models trained for predicting the sentiments of the reviews in the 
chosen dataset. The data is pre-processed, vectorized and fit to 3 machine learning models namely – Naïve Bayes, Support 
Vector Machine and K Nearest Neighbors to predict the sentiment divided into 5 classes namely negative, somewhat negative, 
neutral, positive, somewhat positive. The accuracy of the 3 models is finally calculated and compared with the help of classifier 
score.
